                    <p><b>What is an unfair or unethical business practice?</b><br>Basically, this describes any act that take advantage of consumers. It could be when a business—or an individual acting as a business—give false or misleading information about products or services. It could also describe abusive behavior by people who you have a contract or a financial relationship with, like a landlord or a creditor. </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        Here are just some of the many practices you can submit a complaint about:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improper Billing</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>False or Misleading Advertising</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Harassment from a Debt Collector</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Unfair Treatment by a Landlord</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Mortgage Fraud</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        <b>Who should submit a complaint?</b><br>
                        We take complaints from:
                        <ul>
                            <li>People who live in Salt Lake City</li>
                    <p>AND</p>
                    <li>People who have interacted with a business in Salt Lake City, but don’t live here</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>We want to hear from <u>you.</u></b><br>Certain groups, such as women, people of color, low-income consumers, and immigrants, are the most likely to experience problems with unethical businesses. Many of the people who are most frequently impacted are people who are least likely to report their experiences.</p>
                    <p>Our office wants to hear from <i>all</i> consumers who believe they have received unfair treatment from a Salt Lake City business. You can click <a href="#">here</a> to learn more about nondiscrimination protections.</p>

                    <br>

                    <p><b>You can submit an anonymous complaint.</b><br>You don’t have to identify yourself on our form if you don’t want to.</p>
                    <p>Note: Some businesses in Salt Lake City are not required to be licensed by the city. If the business or individual from your complaint isn’t under the City’s jurisdiction, we may refer your complaint to the state Division of Consumer Protection or Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing (DOPL). If this is the case, we will contact you to let you know that your complaint is being referred. </p>
